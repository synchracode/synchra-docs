When you create a custom command, you can include **variables** in the response to make it dynamic and more useful. Variables are special placeholders that the bot replaces with live information when the command is used.

## How to Use Variables

Variables are written like this: `{variable_name}`  
Some variables can also take options or extra input, like this: `{variable_name input}`

When someone triggers the command, the bot will replace the variable with the correct value automatically.

## Example Variables

| Variable                             | Description                                            | Example                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{accountage}`                       | Shows how old the user’s account is.                   | `Account created {accountage} ago.`                            |
| `{countdown 2025-07-01T18:00:00+02}` | Shows how much time is left until a date/time.         | `Only {countdown 2025-07-01T18:00:00+02} until the big event!` |
| `{spotify.song_name}`                | Shows the name of the current song playing on Spotify. | `Now playing: {spotify.song_name}`                             |

## Tips

- You can mix text and variables freely in your command responses.
- Make sure the variable format is correct, including any needed input (like a city name or date).
- If a variable doesn’t return anything, it might mean the bot doesn’t have the data right now (like no song playing on Spotify).

## Example Command

**Command:** `!countdown`  
**Response:** `The event starts in {countdown 2025-07-01T18:00:00+02}`  

When someone types `!countdown`, the bot replies with how much time is left until the event.
