The count variable lets you and your chat keep track of a number that can be increased or decreased with commands.
Be it deaths, kills, rounds won, times a thing has been written in chat or anything else you can think of.

### `{count <counter_name>}`

Displays the current count.

<Aside type="note" title="Example response">
  `6`
</Aside>

### `{count.inc <counter_name> [-/+amount]}`

Increases or decreases the count by the specified amount (default is 1).
You can use e.g. `-5` to decrease the count by 5. 
Amount works as a default, you can also specify it in the command itself.

<Aside type="note" title="Example response">
  `7`
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Example usage">
  `Death count: {count.inc deaths 1}`
</Aside>

### `{count.set <counter_name> [amount]}`

Sets the count to a specific amount. Use it for example to reset the count to 0.
The amount can also be specifed in the command itself.
