import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Use `{permit_manager}` to allow a user to post a link for a limited time.

### How it works

The permit lasts for 60 seconds and lets the specified user post links without restrictions.

<Aside type="tip" title="Example command">
`!permit <user>`
</Aside>

When you use this command, the specified user will be allowed to post links for the next 60 seconds.
