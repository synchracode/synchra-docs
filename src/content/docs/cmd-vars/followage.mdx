description: Variables to display how long a user has been following.
---

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

These variables show how long someone has been following or the exact follow date and time.

<Aside type="note" title="How it works">
  If the command is used without mentioning a user (e.g. `!followage`), it will
  show the info for the person who sent the message. If a username is provided
  as the first argument (e.g. `!followage SomeUser`), it will show the info for
  that user instead.
</Aside>
