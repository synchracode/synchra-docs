Use `{permit_manager}` to allow a user to post a link for a limited time.

---

### How it works

The permit lasts for 60 seconds and lets the specified user post links without restrictions.

**Example command:**  
`!permit <user>`

When you use this command, the specified user will be allowed to post links for the next 60 seconds.
