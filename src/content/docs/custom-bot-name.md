By default Synchra uses the SynchraBot account in your chats.

If you want to use your own bot name we have made it easy.  
Go to your **Synchra Dashboard > Platforms**, click **Settings** and **Connect Bot**.

Copy the link and sign in to your bot account.  
If you are already signed in to your own account we recommend opening another browser, 
or use a private/incognito window, and paste the URL in the address bar.

Shortcuts for private/incognito windows:

**Windows / Linux**
  - `Ctrl + Shift + N` → Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera
  - `Ctrl + Shift + P` → Firefox

**macOS**
  - `⌘ + Shift + N` → Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Safari
  - `⌘ + Shift + P` → Firefox
